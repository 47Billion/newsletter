> It’s been 4 months since I joined 47B. Initial couple of weeks I felt lost, new place, new faces, felt as if this was my first job. Later, during the second week here, I felt involved and engaged as I was loaded with so much of work that I almost felt like running away. Since then till now story remains the same, everything that I get is always “Urgent and Important”. Past few months have been really fun and productive. We have made a few changes and some more are in the pipeline:


## Recruitment Process
Smooth Recruitment process has been established with the panels inside and candidates outside. I am very thankful to the panels for accepting my eleventh hour request to conduct interviews, spending 30-60 minutes with a candidate on such a short notice. Appreciate it completely! Please keep cooperating.

## New Hires
Every new hire is introduced personally to all the team-members of 47B which is called a “Facility Tour”. This establishes a bond right from day 1. A Welcome email is sent across to everyone at 47Billion with a short description of the new joiner so that it is easy to know the person.

## Blog
While writing a blog on Employee Empathy, I was filled with series of stories and emotions. It went live. Received good number of views and applause, still I know I can do better. Please contribute to blogs guys. Besides helping company’s reputation, it will help you establish your brand too.
